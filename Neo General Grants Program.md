## About 

The Neo General Grants Program is primarily focused on funding the development of tools and infrastructure for the Neo Blockchain. For more info about other **Neo Grants**, please visit our [Neo Grants page](https://github.com/gracegui43/Neo-Grants) on GitHub to get detailed information. 

The Neo Foundation tends to support teams for excellent blockchain software development initiatives. We expect teams and deliverables to be **adoption-driven**, **developer-friendly**, **delivered on-time** and **provide value to the Neo ecosystem**. For more specific information on our funding priorities, please take a look at the [Neo Stack](https://github.com/gracegui43/Neo-Grants/blob/master/Neo%20Stack.md) and our [Accepted Grant Applications](https://github.com/gracegui43/Neo-Grants/blob/master/Accepted%20Grant%20Applications.md). Some examples of the components we deem high priority are marked in the [Neo Stack](https://github.com/gracegui43/Neo-Grants/blob/master/Neo%20Stack.md).





## Funding 

### Project Funding
The average funding for a project is around **$5,000** to **$50,000**, and the typical maximum funding is **$100,000**. However, if the project can provide extraordinary value to the Neo ecosystem, additional funding may be granted. Generally, the Neo Foundation decides the funding for a project based on the time, difficulty, importance, and priority to the Neo ecosystem, alongside the developer-friendly nature of the project. Most of the proposed projects should be expected to be completed within **6 months**. 

For new projects with complexity as well as existing projects with major upgradtes, grants may be applied in stages according to its roadmap. For existing projects, teams need to complete and deliver on the previous grant as described in their application before receiving any additional funds. The Neo Foundation Grants Committee will decide whether to approve the new grant application.


### Sustaining Engineering
Usually the team should continue to maintain the project properly for one year after development, including the normal operation of the project, fixing bugs, incremental upgrades, and user support, etc. An **additional 10%** of the project funding will be distributed to the team to go towards its annual maintenance after all the milestones in the roadmap are finished. 

If an existing project requires a major upgrade, such as adding a large number of new functions/capabilities or adapting to a major change at the protocol layer (such as migration from Neo Legacy to N3), the team can apply for a new grant.

If a project that has received a grant can no longer be properly maintained, its original team is under obligation to assist the new team with comprehensive project migration and relevant handover. Expenses incurred during periods of non-maintenance will be deducted. If the team is unwilling to assist with the migration, the full maintaining fee will be withheld.





## Assessment Criteria
1. **Open source**

	All projects' repositories should be open-source on GitHub with a preferred license, such as MIT or Apache 2.0.
	
2. **On-time delivery**

	All projects should have a clear plan with milestones within 6 months. The funding will be distributed after milestone-based evaluation is satisfied at each stage. 10% of the milestone funding will be deducted if the project is delayed beyond 10%-30% of the expected completion time, and 20% of the milestone funding will be deducted for delays exceeding 30% beyond the expected completion time.

3. **Development quality** 

	The project should be able to achieve the desired goals, and all the planned functions/capabilities should be fully implemented and tested. In addition, the developer experience, performance, scalability, security, and coordination with mainstream industry standards will be taken into account when assessing the quality of each milestone deliverable.

4. **Detailed documentation**

	All projects should provide detailed documentation, and are recommended to provide tutorials with either docs or videos. The documentation should include a project introduction, usage scenarios & examples, the reference implementation, and an FAQ. Make yourself familiar with common terminologies in the Neo ecosystem and stick to them. Follow best practices in code documentation, such as [Documentation Best Practices](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/documentation_best_practices.md#) or [How to document source code responsibly](https://medium.com/@andrewgoldis/how-to-document-source-code-responsibly-2b2f303aa525). Comprehensive documentation should be provided at the time of final delivery. 

5. **Neo family branding**

	All projects are recommended to incorporate Neo branding related design elements into the project design. For details, please refer to [Neo Press Kit](https://neo.org/presskit).
	
6. **Real-world Adoption**
	
	All project should consider real-world usage scenarios. If a project is widely adopted by developers and users with large developer/user base, additional rewards will be provided.





## Application & Evaluation
### Grant Application

Use the [Grant Application Template](https://github.com/gracegui43/Neo-Grants/blob/master/Grant%20Application%20Template.md) to fill in the details of the proposed project and send it to [grants@neo.org](mailto:grants@neo.org). The Neo Foundation Grants Committee will contact the team within approximately two weeks of receipt of the application.

### Application Review

The Neo Foundation Grants Committee may comment and request changes to the proposal after its review of the grant application. On reaching agreement, the Committee will send feedback to inform the team of the final decision and any corresponding requirements.

### Milestone Delivery

Approved grant applications can refer to [Milestone Deliverables Guidelines](#milestone-deliverables-guidelines) and send the milestone report to [grants@neo.org](mailto:grants@neo.org).

### Milestone Review

The Committee will check the deliverables according to the milestones previously set in the application, and will give feedback to the team. Since this process requires NF committee to try all the features and test changes to be able to provide useful feedback, it may take about 1-2 weeks or even longer before giving feedback depending on the complexity. If there are specific suggestions for improvement, the team should refer to them.

### Milestone Payment

Funding will be sent within two weeks if the Committee agrees that milestone requirements are mostly fulfilled.

## Milestone Deliverables Guidelines

We kindly ask you to consider the following guidelines when you submit your project milestone for evaluation. Please submit your milestone updates by email to [grants@neo.org](mailto:grants@neo.org).

The submission should contain the following information:

- **Project name**
- **Link to the open-source code/delivery**
- **Basic [testing guide](#testing-guide)**
- **A list of the [milestone deliverables](#milestone-deliverables)**
- **Any [additional information](#additional-information)**

### Testing Guide

Please provide detailed documentation on how to install, compile, run, and/or test the deliverables. Documentation must be publicly available, such as a readme file or similar. This will make it easier for the community to use or adapt this project. For installation, we prefer docker images in order to avoid problems with versions and dependencies.

### Milestone Deliverables

Please provide a detailed list of milestone deliverables. Each item in the list should include a link to the deliverable itself. If necessary, please highlight anything that deviates from the proposal and include additional information that you think is relevant to the deliverables.

| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |
| ------ | ----------- | ---- | ----- |
| 1.     | ...         | ...  | ...   |
| 2.     | ...         | ...  | ...   |

### Additional Information

Please include any additional comments that may be relevant for evaluation.
