## About Core Developers 

Neo is an open-source, community-driven platform for decentralized applications. From its beginning, Neo has been developed through open-source contributions on GitHub. Anyone can make contributions to the Neo core codebase, including shipping new features, proposing NEPs, submitting patches, improving documentation, etc.

Developers who have made outstanding contributions to the Neo core codebase, after being evaluated by the Neo Foundation, will be offered the opportunity to become Core Developers. Core Developers are empowered to manage and evolve the Neo core codebase and are deeply involved in Neo's technical and engineering decisions; therefore they are required to participate actively and regularly.

***Note that community contributors who become ‘Core Developers’ are not employees of the Neo Foundation (NF) or the Neo Global Development (NGD). Core Developers can choose their preferred way of contributing to the Neo protocol. However, we expect that you always do so with good intentions and never with the intention of harm.***



### Qualification

We are seeking experts from a variety of backgrounds which include but not limited to:

- Blockchain architecture

- Distributed systems: P2P protocols, consensus mechanisms, fault tolerance, scalability techniques, etc. 

- Applied cryptography: blockchain privacy protocols and permission, cryptographic data structures, etc.

- Network and storage: transactional logs, indexed data structures, transport layer protocols, etc.

- Blockchain and internet security

  


### Responsibilities

Core Developers will gain the following permissions and honors; at the same time, they need to assume corresponding responsibilities: 

**1. GitHub Contribution**

Since the Neo protocol is developed through GitHub open-source contributions, Core Developers should actively participate in the online discussion, development, and review in [The Neo Project](https://github.com/neo-project) repositories to ship new functions or version iterations. Core Developers should make important contributions to Neo's technical solution and implementation.

**2. Neo Technical Architecture and Roadmap Design**

Core Developers can deeply participate in Neo's technical architecture and roadmap design, write Neo specifications, and define Neo's long-term technical development direction; and, they can participate in or convene core developer meetings to quickly discuss topics that they feel important.

Correspondingly, Core Developers should maintain the exploration and research of the latest technology in the industry, carry out innovative thinking and pay attention to the engineering realization on Neo, to sustain and grow Neo’s innovation and leadership in the industry.

**3. The Neo Project GitHub Management** 

Core Developers will be added to [The Neo Project](https://github.com/neo-project) repositories as a `collaborator` or higher and will be given `write` permission. This means that they are granted `commit` privileges to the repositories of The Neo Project. Core Developers will be able to approve or reject all Pull Requests to these repositories and if necessary even revert previously merged ones for further discussion. In addition, Core Developers will be able to manage the `issues` tab on the GitHub repositories, including opening and closing issues, and assigning them to different categories.

Correspondingly, Core Developers should actively participate in the management of [The Neo Project](https://github.com/neo-project). Responsibilities include but are not limited to:

- Maintaining [effective communication](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#communicating-effectively) and being prompt in responding to questions to guide other developers.
- Sustaining Neo's open-source spirit to facilitate good proposals that are initiated by others. 
- Maintaining the order of GitHub contributions to create a positive contribution environment.

**4. Public Presentation in Social Channels, Conferences, and Media**

Neo Core Developers will enjoy high honors in the Neo community and the blockchain industry. They will have opportunities to attend top-tier blockchain conferences, to give presentations and talks, and to have interviews with well-known blockchain media and across various social channels on behalf of Neo.



### Incentive

As a Core Developer, in addition to the varied opportunities to get in touch with and implement the most cutting-edge technology in the blockchain industry and expand their personal branding and social influence, the Neo Foundation also provides good incentive to reward their great contributions to Neo. Generally, the Core Developer Grants adopts a two-part reward model. 

***Note that all the grants will be paid in equivalent NEO.***

**1. Contribution Reward**

Core Developers will receive quarterly grants based on their active contributions to the following Neo repositories:

- [neo](https://github.com/neo-project/neo)
- [neo-vm](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-vm)
- [neo-devpack-dotnet](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-devpack-dotnet) (compiler only)
- [neo-modules](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-modules)

To encourage substantial improvements to the Neo protocol layer, the Neo Foundation will evaluate the contributions of PRs merged into the master branch, including: 

- Commits
- PR participation
- PR review

Evaluation is based on the time estimation, its importance, and priority. The Neo Foundation will distribute the Contribution Reward for the previous quarter at the beginning of each subsequent quarter.

However, if the Core Developer has already received a full-time salary through other existing teams by contributing to the protocol development, he/she will not receive the Contribution Reward.

**2. Fellowship Reward**

We expect Core Developers to invest a substantial amount of time to contribute to Neo’s technical direction as well as specific engineering issues and topics, which are critical towards the Neo protocol’s long-term evolution. Therefore, the Neo Foundation will provide a one-year MOU to each official Core Developer, during which they can obtain a $2,000 monthly stipend as the Fellowship Reward as long as they maintain continuous contributions. 





## How to Become A Core Developer 

If you want to become a Core Developer, we suggest that you take the following path:

**1. Learn & Contribute**

Contribute to [The Neo Project](https://github.com/neo-project) repositories on GitHub and get familiar with the Neo protocol. 

**2. Apply**

If you feel that you have the qualities we are looking for and are willing to participate deeply in Neo's protocol development and long-term technical roadmap planning, you can send an email to [dev@neo.org](mailto:dev@neo.org) with attached materials that can prove you meet the Core Developer requirements. 

Existing Core Developers can recommend suitable candidates in the Core Developer Meeting for discussion. 

**3. Initial Review & Trial Period**

Once the application is submitted, the current Core Developer team will review it. If more than half of the Core Developers agree, the applicant will be nominated as a Core Developer Candidate and start a 3-month trial period. During the trial period, the Candidate needs to contribute and prove himself/herself qualified and will receive the Contribution Reward accordingly. 

**4. Evaluation**

After 3 months, the Neo Foundation will evaluate the Candidate's performance and decide whether to endorse him/her in the role of an official Core Developer. Once the Candidate becomes an official Core Developer, his/her information will be added to the Core Developer list, he/she will get the GitHub `write` permission and begin to receive the Fellowship Reward.
