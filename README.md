## Introduction

### About Neo

Neo is an open-source, community-driven platform for decentralized applications. It is the first public blockchain project initiated in China, and was founded in 2014 by Da Hongfei and Erik Zhang. In 2017, along with the rebranding from Antshares, Neo established the vision for the "Smart Economy", utilizing blockchain technology and digital identity to digitize assets, and the use of smart contracts to automate the management of these digital assets.

Neo has a large number of global developer communities including countless blockchain technophiles and developers. The core capabilities of Neo allow developers to efficiently build, deploy, and scale smart contract applications on the Neo blockchain, with the goal of realizing the most developer-friendly blockchain platform in the industry.
